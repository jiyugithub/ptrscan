TO FIX:

1) When testing on large targes, the debug state dump will segfault. This does not occur if the debug output is redirected (via '2>') to a file. While unclear, this may be related to the segfault thrown when exceptions are improperly caught.

    -I speculate that output to TTY is slow and the output buffer fills, resulting in 
     a fail on one of the output functions, which (as intended or accidentally) throws 
     an exception, which is improperly caught.

    -Analyse core dump in future.



TO ADD (URGENT):

    -change args.extra_region_vector -> args.extra_static_vector v
    -define regions to scan v
    -define offsets (reverse order(?)) v
    -blacklist segments v



TO ADD:

!!!) way to export only static chains

1) ncurses interface
2) export .pscan files to either .json or .csv for easy integration with scripting 
   languages


TO FIX (LONG TERM):

1) add const where appropriate
2) if scale increases, encapsulate everything
