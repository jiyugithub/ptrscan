[FIX]

- Implement separate .pscan reading code which just displays the chains without
  trying to link them to existing backing objects. It also shouldn't take a target 
  argument.



[FEATURES]

-Implement a handler for CTRL+C during scanning which will terminate the scan and save the results acquired so far.

-Differentiate between different objects with same pathname/basename.

-Add option to export results to .csv instead of .pscan.
